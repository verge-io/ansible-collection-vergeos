# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`site_sync` + `site_sync_info` modules**: site-to-site replication
  (ioReplicate) as code, plus the derived facts a watchdog needs - age of each
  sync's last run, and the stale/unhealthy lists. Incoming syncs are reported
  but never managed, because an incoming sync belongs to the receiving system.
- **`dr_replication` role**: reconcile declared replication, optionally purge
  what is not declared, optionally trigger and wait, then fail on lag or
  unhealthy state. With nothing declared it is a pure watchdog and converges
  nothing.
- **`node_info` + `node_maintenance` modules**: node state, and drain / return
  to service / restart. Draining the last usable node is refused unless forced.
- **`update` + `update_info` modules**: the system-wide platform update
  lifecycle (check, download, install). Applying an update is per node and is
  deliberately not done here.
- **`rolling_update` role**: install an update, then restart each node that
  needs it - drain, restart, wait down, wait back, return to service, health
  gate. Requires explicit consent before restarting anything.
- **`tests/unit/test_jinja_filters.py`**: asserts every Jinja filter and test
  used in a role or example actually exists.

### Notes

- A site sync that has never run counts as behind RPO. "No timestamp" and
  "just replicated" must not look alike - a replication target configured once
  and never exercised is precisely the failure the check exists to surface.
- Sync health is conservative: healthy only when the platform positively
  reports online and error-free. An unreadable state is unhealthy, never
  assumed green.
- Site sync drift is compared against the table's field spelling, not the
  SDK's keyword. The SDK says `queue_retry_interval_seconds` where the row
  says `queue_retry_interval`; comparing the wrong one reports drift on every
  run.
- The rolling health gate compares against a baseline captured before the run,
  not against the previous iteration - otherwise the expected node count
  drifts down one node at a time and the gate never fires.
- `update` idempotence is by consequence, not bookkeeping. The platform records
  that updates are installed, not that a check was performed, so `checked` and
  `downloaded` run each time until an install has happened.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Python 3.9+ Required**: The collection now requires Python >= 3.9
- **Ansible 2.14+ Required**: Minimum Ansible version is now 2.14.0
- **pyvergeos SDK Required**: All modules now use the pyvergeos SDK instead of direct HTTP API calls
  - Install with: `pip install pyvergeos`
- **Inventory Plugin Replaced**: The `vergeos` inventory plugin has been replaced with `vergeos_vms`
  - New file extension: `.vergeos_vms.yml` (was `.vergeos.yml`)
  - Sites must now be configured as a list (single site = list of one)
  - Host naming changed to `{site}_{vm_name}` to prevent collisions across sites
  - `ansible_host` is **no longer set** - this is now an API-only plugin (see migration guide)

### Changed

- Migrated all modules to use the pyvergeos Python SDK for API interactions
- **Inventory plugin completely rewritten** with multi-site support:
  - Concurrent site queries using ThreadPoolExecutor
  - Site failures warn and continue (don't fail entire inventory)
  - Full tag support via `vm.get_tags()` SDK method
  - Enhanced caching with full state serialization
  - Configurable grouping: site, status, tags, tenant, os_family, cluster
- Improved error handling with specific exception types from the SDK
- Simplified module code by leveraging SDK resource objects

### Removed

- `VergeOSAPI` class removed from `module_utils/vergeos.py` (use pyvergeos SDK instead)
- `VergeOSAPIError` exception removed (SDK provides specific exception types)

### Added

- `get_vergeos_client()` factory function for creating SDK client instances
- `sdk_error_handler()` helper for consistent error handling across modules
- Support for additional SDK features (typed resources, convenience methods)
- **Multi-site inventory plugin** (`vergeos_vms`) with:
  - Concurrent queries to 100+ VergeOS sites
  - Per-site error handling (warn and continue)
  - Tag-based grouping via `vm.get_tags()` SDK method
  - API key authentication (maps to SDK `token` parameter)
  - Configurable hostname template: `{site}_{name}`
  - Full caching support with state serialization
- Unit tests for modules and inventory plugin
- Integration tests for core functionality

### Migration Guide

1. **Install the pyvergeos SDK**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyvergeos
   ```

2. **Update Python version** (if needed):
   - Ensure Python >= 3.9 is installed

3. **Update Ansible version** (if needed):
   - Ensure Ansible >= 2.14.0 is installed

4. **Existing playbooks using modules**: No changes required - the module interface remains the same

5. **Inventory plugin migration**: The `vergeos` plugin has been replaced with `vergeos_vms`:
   ```yaml
   # v1.x (removed)
   plugin: vergeio.vergeos.vergeos
   host: vergeos.example.com
   username: admin
   password: "{{ lookup('env', 'VERGEOS_PASSWORD') }}"

   # v2.x (required) - note: sites is now a list
   plugin: vergeio.vergeos.vergeos_vms
   sites:
     - name: production
       host: vergeos.example.com
       username: admin
       password: "{{ lookup('env', 'VERGEOS_PASSWORD') }}"
   ```

   **Important changes:**
   - Rename inventory files from `*.vergeos.yml` to `*.vergeos_vms.yml`
   - Host naming is now `{site}_{vm_name}` (e.g., `production_webserver01`)
   - `ansible_host` is **no longer set** - use VergeOS modules with `vergeos_site_url` and `vergeos_vm_id` hostvars
   - New grouping options: `group_by: [site, status, tags, tenant, os_family, cluster]`
   - Multi-site support: add multiple sites to the `sites` list

6. **Custom modules using legacy VergeOSAPI**: The legacy HTTP client has been removed. Migrate to the SDK:
   ```python
   # v1.x (removed)
   from ansible_collections.vergeio.vergeos.plugins.module_utils.vergeos import VergeOSAPI
   api = VergeOSAPI(module)
   vms = api.get('vms')

   # v2.x (required)
   from ansible_collections.vergeio.vergeos.plugins.module_utils.vergeos import get_vergeos_client
   client = get_vergeos_client(module)
   vms = [dict(vm) for vm in client.vms.list()]
   ```
